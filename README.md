# New SubDomain (NSD)

This is a repository for 2023 Akamai Hackaton.  
Our project is the creation of the New SubDomain (NSD) dataset, as well as a brief analysis that instantly proves its 
usefulness for threat intel (detection and prevention).

This project originally started as a DataBricks notebook. After producing the new dataset and conducting a brief 
analysis, we structured it as this Python project.
